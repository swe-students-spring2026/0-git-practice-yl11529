This is a beautiful example of how some of the most seemingly pointless projects have an incredible amount of engineering behind them. Software doesn't always need to have a purpose, or solve a problem, sometimes it can just be impressive for the sake of problem solving.

# Interesting article: "When AI writes almost all code, what happens to software engineering?"

I found this article about Software Engineering interesting because it discusses how the AI modern coding tools like Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Claude are now being capable of generating 90% or more of code for many developers. Since AI can write 90% of code nowadays, I think that we'll need to focus more on design, testing, and being good tech leads.


# Antonio Jackson thoughts
I always find articles like this interesting. There are many different schools of thought on what happens when "AI takes over." I personally know many developers/companies that use AI to write most of their code. I think the new way of software development will be written mostly by AI, guided by knowledgable developers that can determine the quality of work and prompt the AI to get the best results.
