I found this article about Software Engineering interesting because it discusses how the AI modern coding tools like Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, and Claude are now being capable of generating 90% or more of code for many developers. Since AI can write 90% of code nowadays, I think that we'll need to focus more on design, testing, and being good tech leads.
